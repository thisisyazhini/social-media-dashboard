### Social Media Dashboard

This is a react dashboard that shows a user's social media statistics.

[!image] https://github.com/thisisyazhini/SocialMediaDashboard/raw/main/public/socialmedia.jpg

Uses react-chartjs-2 and react-circular-progressbar packages to show the bar chart, line charts and the circular progressbar respectively.

The customisable data is now present in the App.js.

TO-DO : Move the customisable data to a JSON file and read it from there.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
